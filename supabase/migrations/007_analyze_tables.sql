-- Table Analysis and Cleanup Assessment
-- Date: 2025-01-20
-- Purpose: Identify obsolete tables and their dependencies
-- ============================================

-- STEP 1: Analyze current table structure and dependencies
-- ============================================

-- Check if roles table still has references
SELECT

    'OBSOLETE - Replaced by skills' as status,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sh.id) as shifts_using_role_id,
    CASE

        ELSE 'Safe to delete'
    END as dependency_status
FROM roles r
LEFT JOIN shifts sh ON sh.role_id = r.id
GROUP BY 1,2;

-- Check skills table (new replacement)
SELECT
    'skills' as table_name,
    'ACTIVE - New skill management' as status,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    'Keep - Core MVP table' as recommendation
FROM skills;

-- Check staff_skills usage
SELECT
    'staff_skills' as table_name,
    'ACTIVE - Staff-skill relationships' as status,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    'Keep - Core MVP table' as recommendation
FROM staff_skills;

-- Check if skill_tags column in staff table is still needed
SELECT
    'staff.skill_tags column' as item,
    'OBSOLETE - Replaced by staff_skills table' as status,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE skill_tags IS NOT NULL AND array_length(skill_tags, 1) > 0) as non_empty_count,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE skill_tags IS NOT NULL AND array_length(skill_tags, 1) > 0) > 0
        THEN 'Has data - needs migration check'
        ELSE 'Safe to drop column'
    END as recommendation
FROM staff;

-- Check audit_logs usage
SELECT
    'audit_logs' as table_name,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'UNUSED - No records'
        ELSE 'ACTIVE - Has ' || COUNT(*) || ' records'
    END as status,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'Safe to keep or remove based on requirements'
        ELSE 'Keep - Contains audit history'
    END as recommendation

-- Check equipment table usage
SELECT
    'equipment' as table_name,
    'ACTIVE - QR code management' as status,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT venue_id) as venues_using,

-- Check expenses table usage
SELECT
    'expenses' as table_name,
    CASE
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'UNUSED - No records'
        ELSE 'ACTIVE - Has ' || COUNT(*) || ' records'
    END as status,
    COUNT(*) as record_count,
    'Keep if expense tracking is required' as recommendation
